# Coding Quiz Challenge

This is a multiple choice coding quiz challenge. The user will be able to start a 60 second, six question quiz about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They will get real-time correct or incorrect responses. With every incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. At the end of the quiz, the user will know their score and be able to submit it and their initials to a localStorage recent scores list. They can then clear the recent scores and start the quiz anew.
